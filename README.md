5 minutes after I released this game @ https://knightwhosayni.itch.io/runiculous my brother found a bug and it made me a week to resolve. 
Let's say that .Dispose() is sometimes an overkill and we all should be grateful to garbage collector. 
With that said, feel free to download the game and give me feedback with your suggestions and whatnot. 
If you prefer the installer: 
I tried to keep it small, so if the installer complains about .NET Runtime 6.0.16 missing, then please navigate to Microsoft's https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0, install it, and then install Runiculous.

Enjoy.
